### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

I think the most interesting topic we covered is the utilization of all the different languages needed in our project and how they come together to integrate the backend and front end together. Although tough,
I think that learning solidity for Ethereum contract building is a huge change of pace, coming form a high level language like python that I'm used to.

### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

Something we need to look at for our quarter 2 project is how to validate the authenticity of property ownership by the users. We have plans to looat validation through an API, however we have yet to find one that is both effective and free.

### What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

During our quarter 1, we had a lot of times where multiple team members were working on the same bits of code or same research, both not knowing that the other team member was doign the same thing. This would result in a lot of overlap in work done and time not spent efficiently. I think moving forward we have to better delegate roles to our team members so that we can come up with ideas on different sections of our project and teach each other on our respective roles when it comes time to meet each week.

### What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would love to learn CSS more so that we can make a nice and presentable website. Having OpenSea as a reference to what we want to recreate really inspired me to try and make the final product look nice once were done with all the back end logic.
